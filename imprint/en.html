        <h4>Liability for Contents</h4>
        <p>As service providers, we are liable for own contents of these websites according to Paragraph 7, Sect. 1
            German
            Telemedia Act (TMG). However, according to Paragraphs 8 to 10 German Telemedia Act (TMG), service providers
            are
            not obligated to permanently monitor submitted or stored information or to search for evidences that
            indicate
            illegal activities.</p>
        <p>Legal obligations to removing information or to blocking the use of information remain unchallenged. In this
            case, liability is only possible at the time of knowledge about a specific violation of law. Illegal
            contents
            will be removed immediately at the time we get knowledge of them.</p>
        <h4>Liability for Links</h4>
        <p>Our offer includes links to external third party websites. We have no influence on the contents of those
            websites, therefore we cannot guarantee for those contents. Providers or administrators of linked websites
            are
            always responsible for their own contents.</p>
        <p>The linked websites had been checked for possible violations of law at the time of the establishment of the
            link.
            Illegal contents were not detected at the time of the linking. A permanent monitoring of the contents of
            linked
            websites cannot be imposed without reasonable indications that there has been a violation of law. Illegal
            links
            will be removed immediately at the time we get knowledge of them.</p>
